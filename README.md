# BloodBank Smart Contract

The BloodBank smart contract is a decentralized application (DApp) that manages blood transactions and patient records within a blood bank. The smart contract is implemented using Solidity and runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- Register new patients and store their information, such as name, age, blood group, contact details, and home address.
- Track blood transactions between donors and receivers, including the type of patient (donor or receiver), timestamp, sender, and recipient.
- Retrieve patient records by Aadhar number or get all patient records stored in the contract.

## Prerequisites

To interact with the BloodBank smart contract, you will need the following:

- Ethereum wallet or a compatible wallet provider (e.g., MetaMask).
- Solidity compiler (version ^0.8.0) for deploying and testing the smart contract.
